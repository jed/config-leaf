config-leaf
===========

<!--[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jed/config-leaf.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jed/config-leaf) (tests work on my end, but not on travis... WHY?) -->

config-leaf helps you hide your sensitive node.js bits in plain sight. It is based on [John Resig](https://github.com/jeresig)'s post, [Keeping Passwords in Source Control](http://ejohn.org/blog/keeping-passwords-in-source-control/).

The idea is that the configuration of deployed apps can be managed in version control for transparency and ease of rollback. But, since configuration often contains sensitive information like passwords, it shouldn't be kept in plaintext. This is where config-leaf comes in, by letting you encrypt your config in development, check it in, and then decrypt it in production or other dev environments.

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

Let's say that we have a node.js project with some sensitive configuration information, kept in a file called `config.json`.

First, install this library as a dependency of the project:

    npm install config-leaf --save

Then, make sure that you add this file to `.gitignore` (or appropriate ignore file depending on your version control system) to make sure it never gets checked in:

    echo config.json >> .gitignore

Finally, edit your `package.json` to add the `encrypt` and `decrypt` scripts, such as in the following:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "encrypt": "encrypt config.json config.json.cast5",
    "decrypt": "decrypt config.json.cast5 config.json"
  }
}
```

Here, the `encrypt` script will encrypt the `config.json` file as `config.json.cast5`, and the `decrypt` script will decrypt the `config.json.cast5` file as `config.json`. In both cases, the name of the encrypted file can be chosen arbitrarily.

You can choose to bypass manual password entry by supplying the name of an environmental variable you have set to store a password for you using the `--PW` flag:
```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "encrypt": "encrypt config.json config.json.cast5 --PW=ENV_VAR_PW_KEY",
    "decrypt": "decrypt config.json.cast5 config.json --PW=ENV_VAR_PW_KEY"
  }
}
```


Usage
-----

Once config-leaf is installed and configured, run the `encrypt` command every time you update your configuration, and enter the password when prompted.

    npm run encrypt

This saves the encrypted file according to the name you set in your `package.json`.

After checking the file in, use the `decrypt` command in production or other dev environments, and enter the password when prompted.

    npm run decrypt

Again, this saves the decrypted file according to the name you set in your `package.json`.

TODO
----

- Compare timestamps to make sure decrypted file is up to date.
